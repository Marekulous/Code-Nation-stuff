    <h1>Unit 1, outcome 1</h1>
    <h2>The purpose of IT in modern business.</h2>
    <p>Upon successfully completing the course with Code Nation I will be better able to describe the audience to whom the work is targeted, as well as any aspects of the work that makes it particularly suitable for the audience e.g. "I presented a science investigation using a web page with links to references so that a future employer can see the quality of my work simply by knowing the URL". "I used a public web page to collaborate with my friends in producing an information page about the local environment because it enabled us to work together effectively. It also made it easy for other people to contribute and made the results easy to link to other similar sites". I will be able to fully explain the key characteristics of writing formally on a web page to present part of an e-portfolio as opposed to the style used for chat and instant messaging of friends. I will show evidence of understanding relevance in relation to purpose. I will be able to identify which information is irrelevant to a task, which will not support its purpose and identify inaccurate or biased information could be against the purpose. The main difference between Platinum and Gold is that in Platinum, the quality of explanation needs to be explicit and clarity of understanding, whereas in Gold it is enough to describe the purpose e.g. from a list of options or other supporting structures. My documented web pages, blogs and/or files should contain detailed explanations in keeping with the guidance here.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>I can analyse the methods, skills and resources required to complete the task successfully.</h2>
    <p>For example, as a method of presenting information to a general audience, using web pages is often a better choice than desktop presentation software. In a web page, the information is permanently and immediately available to the intended wide audience and this information can be linked to related information in other pages. They might need skills related to e.g. preparing images for use on-line so they are suitable sizes and load quickly on low bandwidth connections. They can describe and explain issues related to copyright (PLTS) and accessibility if they intend others to use the information they prepare. They should have a detailed analysis in each instance. The resources needed could include time, software, hardware or new learning and expertise. Again evidence of analysis and explanation will differentiate from Level 2.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>I can analyse any factors that might affect the task</h2>
    <p>We have to consider how much time the task is likely to take, any copyright issues in obtaining suitable resources, the cost of resources and any e-safety and/or relevant security considerations. This is not intended to be an exhaustive list. The factors considered simply have to be credible and useful in the planning process. Again, being able to critically analyse the factors and relate them to the task is a Level 3 characteristic.</p>
