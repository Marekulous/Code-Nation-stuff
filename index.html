  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>About me: Since coming back to the UK after teaching English in China for 11 years (2004-2015) to students of all ages, backgrounds and capabilities, ranging in age from pre school to senior citizens in many different environments: on an individual basis, in group settings, classrooms, corporate environments, one to one tuition, kindergartens, primary schools, high schools, colleges, universities, further education institutions, and private language schools, I have been volunteering for a homeless charity. At the homeless charity I am a general assistant, however I specialise in interpreting and translating Polish & English for Polish service users. Seeing as Polish is so similar to other Eastern European languages - I have also been able to help speakers of Czech, Slovak, Ukrainian, Serbian, Croatian, and Sorbian. My teaching experience in China has also enabled me to be an adult literacy tutor, empowering service users to be able to function increasingly more independently. I've been Buddhist since 1997 & have a reasonably well established daily meditation practise - whilst in China, I ran an expat meditation group, I have continued doing something similar since my return to the UK, I have taught & facilitated mindfulness & meditation sessions on an individual basis, in group settings, in group settings, classrooms, corporate environments, one to one sessions, at the homeless charity & in recovery group meetings - helping people use meditation & mindfulness in their recovery process, to enhance their "therapy".

    At present my knowledge about technology seems quite rudimentary, quite basic - it has become increasingly apparent how important it is to have up to date computer skills in order to be able to communicate effectively with others using varied media, as well as being able to function even remotely adequately. I made a few enquiries and discovered the amazing opportunity to attend Code Nation's coding course - everybody uses computers all the time for everything, it's coders who "work behind the scenes" making it easy for everybody else to do everything else on their computers - my curiosity about any area I am ignorant about is completely insatiable. We have learned some basic programming, I thoroughly enjoyed writing an adventure game with my team members - everybody has different strengths, different areas of expertise, which we all share to enhance the work of other people too</p>
